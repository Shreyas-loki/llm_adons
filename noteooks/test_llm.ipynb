Board Director Bob \\nStrauss, who served as company chairman and CEO  two decades ago, is returning \\nfrom retirement to assume the role of chairman.\\nParts Unlimited stock has tumbled 19 percent in the last 30 days under heavy \\ntrading, down 52 percent from its peak three years ago. The company continues to \\nbe outmaneuvered by its arch rival, famous for its ability to anticipate and instantly \\nreact to customer needs. Parts Unlimited now trails the competition in sales growth, \\ninventory turns and profitability. \\nThe company has long promised that its “Phoenix” program will restore \\nprofitability and close the gap by tightly integrating its retailing and e-commerce \\nchannels. Already years late, many expect the company to announce another \\nprogram delay in its analyst earnings call next month.\\nWe believe that institutional investors such as Wayne-Yokohama pressured Bob \\nto reconfigure the board as the first of many actions to right the ship in Elkhart \\nGrove. A growing number of investors are pushing for more significant leadership \\nchanges and strategic options, such as splitting up the company.\\nDespite Masters’ past achievements that transformed Parts Unlimited into one of \\nthe top automotive parts manufacturers and retailers, we believe splitting up the \\nchairman and CEO  roles is long overdue. Parts Unlimited needs fresh leadership, \\neither from the outside or from within. We believe Sarah Moulton, SVP  of Retail \\nOperations, and a rising star at the company, could just be what the company \\nneeds.\\nAccording to our sources, the board has given Strauss and Masters six months to \\nmake dramatic improvements. If they can’t pull this off, expect more changes and \\nturbulent times.\\n —Kelly Lawrence, Chief Industry Analyst, Nestor Meyers\\n###'),\n",

He’ll just \\nas often be seen joking with someone as kicking their ass about missing \\na deadline. He has a reputation as a capable and no-nonsense manager. \\nWith nearly two hundred developers working for him, he needs to be. \\nTo help with Phoenix, his team has grown by fifty people in the last \\ntwo years, many through offshore development shops. Chris is con-\\nstantly asked to deliver more features and do it in less time, with less \\nmoney. \\nSeveral of his managers are in the room, too. Wes is also here, sitting \\nright next to Chris. As I start to look for an open chair, I note how ev-\\neryone seems unusually tense. And then I see why.\\nThere, sitting right next to the only open seat at the table, is Steve. \\nEveryone seems to be going to great lengths to not stare at him. As \\nI casually take my seat next to Steve, my phone vibrates. It’s a text mes-\\nsage from Wes:\\nShit. Steve has never attended a project management meeting. We are \\ntotally screwed.\\nKirsten clears her throat.  “First on our agenda is Phoenix. The news isn’t \\ngood. This project went from yellow to red about four weeks ago, and it’s \\nmy personal assessment that the deadline is in grave jeopardy. ”\\nShe continues in her professional voice, “To refresh your memory, \\nlast week there were twelve tasks in the critical path of Phoenix Phase 1. \\nOnly three of those tasks were completed. ”\\nThere is a collective groan in the room, and several people mutter to \\none another. Steve turns to look at me. “Well?”\\nI explain, “The critical resource in question is Brent, who has been \\none hundred percent utilized helping to recover from the payroll failure, '),\n",

They’ve already lured away some of our biggest partners, \\nand our sales force is starting to panic. I’m not the type to say, ‘I told you \\nso, ’ but their latest product announcement shows why we can’t be acting \\nas if this is just business as usual. ”\\nShe continues, “See, Bill, in order for us to increase market share, we \\nmust ship Phoenix. But for some reason, you and your team keep drag -\\nging your feet. Maybe you’re not prioritizing correctly? Or maybe you’re \\njust not used to supporting a project this important?”\\nDespite all my mental preparation, I feel my face get hot with anger. \\nMaybe it was the condescending way she was parroting Steve to me. Or \\nhow she wasn’t even looking at me while she was addressing me, instead \\nlooking at Steve to see how he reacts. Or the way she basically called me \\nout-of-touch and incompetent.\\nEveryone is silent as I force myself to take a deep breath.\\nMy anger dissipates. This is all just corporate theater. I don’t like it \\nbut accept it for what it is. I almost made the Marines my career when I \\nwas up for promotion to staff sergeant. Y ou don’t become a senior NCO  \\nin the Marines without being able to play politics.\\n“Interesting, ” I say to Sarah. “Y ou tell me which is more important: \\ngetting our factory employees paid or getting the Phoenix tasks done? \\nSteve told me to resolve the payroll failure. How would you have priori-\\ntized this differently than Steve?”\\nAt my mention of Steve, Sarah’s expression changes. “Well, maybe \\nif IT didn’t cause the failure in the first place, you wouldn’t have blown \\nyour commitments to us.

If we expedite some things and if the virtualized environ-\\nments from Bill’s team work as expected, we can go into production one \\nweek from Friday. ”\\nI gape at Chris.

Then you add a bunch of devel-\\nopers who use up all the time in the schedule, leaving no time for testing \\nor operations deployment.

Remember, any im-\\nprovement not made at the constraint is just an illusion, yes?\\n“Step 2 is to exploit the constraint, ” he continues. “In other words, \\nmake sure that the constraint is not allowed to waste any time. Ever. \\nIt should never be waiting on any other resource for anything, and it \\nshould always be working on the highest priority commitment the IT  \\nOperations organization has made to the rest of the enterprise. Always. ”\\nI hear him say encouragingly, “Y ou’ve done a good job exploiting \\nthe constraint on several fronts. Y ou’ve reduced reliance on Brent for \\nunplanned work and outages. Y ou’ve even started to figure out how to \\nexploit Brent better for the three other types of work: business and IT  \\nprojects and changes. Remember, unplanned work kills your ability to \\ndo planned work, so you must always do whatever it takes to eradicate \\nit. Murphy does exist, so you’ll always have unplanned work, but it must \\nbe handled efficiently. Y ou’ve still got a long way to go. ”\\nIn a more stern voice, he says, “But you’re ready to start thinking \\nabout Step 3, which is to subordinate the constraint. In the Theory of \\nConstraints, this is typically implemented by something called Drum-\\nBuffer-Rope. In The Goal , the main character, Alex, learns about this \\nwhen he discovers that Herbie, the slowest Boy Scout in the troop, ac-\\ntually dictates the entire group’s marching pace.

There’s got to be some simple way to pri-\\noritize this list that doesn’t look like moving a bunch of boxes around.\\nSuddenly, I remember how Erik described the importance of pre-\\nventive work, such as the monitoring project. I say, “I don’t care how \\nimportant everyone thinks  their project is. We need to know whether \\nit increases our capacity at our constraint, which is still  Brent.

Preventive \\nwork is important, but it always gets deferred. We’ve been trying to do \\nsome of these projects for years! This is our chance to get caught up. ”\\nPatty says quickly, “Didn’t you hear what Erik told Bill? Improving \\nsomething anywhere not at the constraint is an illusion.

One sales person missing their number \\nrarely jeopardizes the entire department.\\nOn the other hand, any of my engineers can get me fired by making a \\nseemingly small, harmless change that results in a crippling, enterprise-\\nwide outage.\\nRon slams down the phone. “Sorry, guys.

We’re closing \\nour monitoring gaps, we’ve refactored or replaced our top ten fragile \\nartifacts so that they’re more stable, and the flow of planned work is \\nfaster than ever. Against my expectations, everyone jumped enthusiasti-\\ncally on Project Narwhal otherwise known as the “Simian Army Chaos \\nMonkey” project. Like the legendary stories of the original Apple Mac \\nOS and Netflix cloud delivery infrastructure, we deployed code that rou-\\ntinely created large-scale faults, thus randomly killing processes or en-\\ntire servers.\\nOf course, the result was all hell breaking loose for an entire week \\nas our test, and occasionally, production infrastructure crashed like a \\nhouse of cards. But, over the following weeks, as Development and IT  \\nOperations worked together to make our code and infrastructure more \\nresilient to failures, we truly had IT services that were resilient, rugged, \\nand durable.\\nJohn loved this, and started a new project called “Evil Chaos Monkey. ” \\nInstead of generating operational faults in production, it would con-\\nstantly try to exploit security holes, fuzz our applications with storms of \\nmalformed packets, try to install backdoors, gain access to confidential \\ndata, and all sorts of other nefarious attacks.\\nOf course, Wes tried to stop this. He insisted that we schedule pene-\\ntration tests into predefined time frames. However, I convinced him this \\nis the fastest means to institutionalize Erik’s Third Way. We need to cre-\\nate a culture that reinforces the value of taking risks and learning from \\nfailure and the need for repetition and practice to create mastery. \\nI don’t want posters about quality and security. I want improvement \\nof our daily work showing up where it needs to be: in our daily work. \\nJohn’s team developed tools that stress-tested every test and produc-\\ntion environment with a continual barrage of attacks. And like when we \\nfirst released the chaos monkey, immediately over half their time was \\nspent fixing security holes and hardening the code. After several weeks, \\nthe developers were deservedly proud of their work, successfully fend-\\ning off everything that John’s team was able to throw at them. \\nThese are the thoughts going through my head as I wind my way to-\\nward Steve’s house.

He’s living a life that seems to have tran-\\nscended our mortal plane of existence.\\nAs if Steve knows what I’m thinking, he says, “Y ou know, when Erik \\nand I first met, many months ago, he said that the relationship between \\nIT and the business is like a dysfunctional marriage—both feel power -\\nless and held hostage by the other.

In some Erik-like way, something about what he \\nsays seems inescapably true.\\nIn that moment, I decide. I’ll still have to talk with Paige, but I know \\nwith certainty that the journey Steve wants to send me on is important—\\nboth for me and my family and for my entire profession.\\n“I’ll think about it, ” I say, solemnly. \\nSteve smiles broadly and stands up.

Left unchecked, the con-flict increases time to market for Development, creates longer and more \\nproblematic deployments during feature releases, increases the number \\nof Sev 1 outages, and IT Operations becomes increasingly buried with unplanned work, making it difficult to retire technical debt.\\nWe now know that it is possible to break this conflict between \\nDevelopment and IT Operations. The proof is that high-performing \\norganizations such as Amazon, Google, Twitter, Etsy, and Netflix are adopting a set of techniques that we now call DevOps, and they are rou-\\ntinely deploying hundreds or even thousands of production changes per \\nday, while preserving world-class reliability, stability, and security. By instituting a set of cultural norms, processes, and practices, these high performers are achieving breathtaking performance.\\nThey are able to quickly deploy changes into production, with a code \\ndeployment lead time1 measured in minutes or hours, enabling them to innovate and out-experiment their competition in the marketplace, with higher quality and better customer outcomes.'),\n",

And because code deployments happen in the middle of the afternoon instead of on weekends, for the \\nfirst time in decades, IT Operations is working during normal business \\nhours, like everyone else.\\nJust how did code deployment become routine?

Instead, code is only “done” when it has been fully tested and is operating in production as designed.

ITIL and ITSM  remain the best codifications of the processes \\nthat underpin IT Operations, and actually describe many of the capabilities needed in order for IT Operations to support a DevOps-style work stream.\\n In order to accommodate the faster lead times and higher deploy-\\nment frequencies associated with DevOps, many areas of the ITIL  pro-\\ncesses require automation, specifically around the change, configuration, and release processes.'),\n",

Briefly, the five original TOC  steps are:\\n• Identify the constraint\\n• Exploit the constraint\\n• Subordinate all other activities to the constraint\\n• Elevate the constraint to new levels\\n• Find the next constraint\\nIn The Goal , the constraints were initially the famous NCX-10 robot, \\nthen the heat treat ovens, and then the constraint becomes market de-mand. In The Phoenix Project, the constraint was initially Brent because \\nhe was always dealing with unplanned work, then the application de-\\nployment process, and then the constraint moved outside the organiza-tion because the needed MRP  application support was outsourced.\\nIn Dr. Goldratt’s following book, It’s Not Luck , he describes what he \\ncalled the Thinking Processes, which is a fantastic (but somewhat inac-cessible and often very slow) methodology of identifying core, chronic conflicts, capturing the current reality, describing the desired future re-ality, and various planning techniques to increase the likelihood of get-\\nting there successfully.\\nBy far, the very best overview of the entire TOC , the Thinking \\nProcesses, and Dr. Goldratt’s body of knowledge is an audiobook called Beyond The Goal . It includes all of his recorded lectures from 2005 and \\nis a breathtaking tour of Dr. Goldratt’s life journey, describing his con-\\ntributions, tools, and case studies.\\nEight years ago, it was well known that the Thinking Processes were \\nthe tools and techniques he used to construct The Goal . That’s why my \\ncoauthors and I tried to learn more about it, but we couldn’t find any training or books, beyond Dr. Goldratt’s writings, that were feasible for us to attend or buy.

In his model, the five dysfunctions are described as:\\n• Absence of trust—unwilling to be vulnerable within the group\\n• Fear of conflict—seeking artificial harmony over constructive passionate debate\\n• Lack of commitment—feigning buy-in for group decisions cre-ates ambiguity throughout the organization\\n• Avoidance of accountability—ducking the responsibility to call peers on counterproductive behavior, which sets low standards\\n• Inattention to results—focusing on personal success, status, and \\nego before team success\\nWhen I think about the long, bitter intertribal warfare that has existed \\nbetween Development and IT Operations, as well as between IT and \\n“the business, ” I suspect that we will very much need the lessons of Mr. \\nLencioni to achieve the DevOps ideal.\\nOften, the first step in using Mr. Lencioni’s methodology is for lead-\\ners to enable themselves to become vulnerable (or at the very least, start \\nby modeling vulnerable behaviors).19 In The Phoenix Project, Steve has \\nalready internalized these practices for decades and leads what is called \\na personal history exercise.20\\nI was fortunate enough to have personally observed and benefited '),\n",

They reduced this down to five.\\n• They then created a buffer of work, so that any blocked Dev or Test person could work on something in the buffer.\\n• Their lead time went from 155 days to twenty-two days. Lead times were so good that they created a new SLA  guarantee of twenty-five \\ndays (Wow!).\\n• Their next surge in productivity came from increasing the num-ber of developers, because for every two days of Dev work, it re-\\nquired one day of Test work. They promoted testers who wanted \\nto move into Dev, and increased the Dev:Test ratio from 1:1 to 2:1.\\n• The result of all of this? They completed their entire three years of backlog in nine months; demand for their services went up, \\nand they continued to deliver everything that was asked for each \\nmonth; no one got fired, and instead people got promoted.\\nAs Dumitriu said, “We succeeded because we focused relentlessly on re-ducing lead time, as opposed to Dev & Test optimizing for themselves. ”\\nThis story is just one of many astounding transformations that are \\ndescribed in brilliant detail.
